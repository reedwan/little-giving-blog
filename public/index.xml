      <description>&lt;p&gt;An Aid 4 Ummah delegation visted Sierra Leone in December 2024 and distributed 500 copies of the Quran on behalf of Little Giving users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Access to the Quran is limited in rural areas of West Africa, where students often use wooden tablets to memorize verses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the Quran were distributed in MacDonald and Collatree villages in Waterloo through daily donations by Little Giving users. Over the last 12 years, Aid 4 Ummah have distributed over 50,000 copies of the Quran in Sierra Leone.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Messenger (sallallahu alayhi wa-sallam) said, &amp;ldquo;Verily actions are only according to intentions and every man shall have according to what he has intended. Whoever makes hijra for Allah and His Messenger, then his hijra is to Allah and His Messenger, and whoever makes hijra to achieve some worldly benefit or to take a woman in marriage, then his hijra is to that for which he made hijra.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the hadith with which Imam Bukhari (rahimahullah) began his Sahih making it the prologue to his book. Shaykh Abdur Rahman bin Mahdi (rahimahullah) said, &amp;ldquo;Had I composed a book in the form of chapters, I would have placed the hadith of Umar ibn Khattab (radiallahu anhu) on intention in every chapter. This hadith is one of the hadiths that is central to this religion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
