      <description>Over the last few months Mothers of Afghanistan have been facilitating daily bread distribution in Kabul on behalf of Little Giving users.
Mothers of Afghanistan is a UK registered charity (1190531) that works in Kabul, Jalalabad, Paktika and other areas of Afghanistan.
In Kabul, Mothers of Afghanistan have set up a bread voucher scheme for widows and the poor. Families are assessed and given vouchers which they can use to collect freshly baked bread from local bakeries.</description>
