An Aid 4 Ummah delegation visted Sierra Leone in December 2024 and distributed 500 copies of the Quran on behalf of Little Giving users.

Access to the Quran is limited in rural areas of West Africa, where students often use wooden tablets to memorize verses.

Copies of the Quran were distributed in MacDonald and Collatree villages in Waterloo through daily donations by Little Giving users. Over the last 12 years, Aid 4 Ummah have distributed over 50,000 copies of the Quran in Sierra Leone. The charity also runs an education complex, orphanage, and medical facility in the country.
