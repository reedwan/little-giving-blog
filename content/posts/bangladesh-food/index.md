Lonely Orphans have been facilitating meals for Rohingya refugees on behalf of Little Giving users since April 2021.

The charity operates several shelters supporting refugees in a number of camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. This area is the world's largest refugee settlement, accommodating about one million refugees.

As of August 2023, 50,200 meals have been provided across five camps in the area (Balukhali, Jadimore, Kutupalong, Shamlapur, and Tangkali) through daily donations by Little Giving users.
