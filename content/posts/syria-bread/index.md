Over the past two years, Ummah Welfare Trust (UWT) have facilitated daily bread distribution in Syria for Little Giving users.

Since May 2021, the charity have run a bakery in Idlib, distributing packs of bread to 6,200 families (about 30,000 people), six days a week. Little Giving users made up about 4% of that figure (about 250 families).

Recipients were mainly refugees living in camps or temporary shelter in Idlib and the surrounding areas. The project ran until November 2022.
